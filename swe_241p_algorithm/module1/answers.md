# Task-1: Count the number of primitive operations executed below and determine the best & the worst cases: (1 points)

The worst cases and the best cases should be the same in O(n), since there are not any early returns in the while loop.

# Task-2: Determine the Big-O notation for: (3 points)
 O(n)
 O(n^2)
O(n^3*log n)


# Task-3: Determine the Complexity Of The Following Small Functions: (6 points)	
time complexity: O(n)
time complexity: O(n^2)
time complexity: O(n^2)
time complexity: O(n)
time complexity: O(n log n)
time complexity: O(n)
